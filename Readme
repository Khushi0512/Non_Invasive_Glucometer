Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring System (IR-Based Prototype)
This repository contains Arduino codes, signal-processing logic, and experiment logs for developing a non-invasive glucometer using IR absorption and Beer-Lambert’s law. The system detects finger presence, measures photodiode voltage, computes absorbance, and converts it into glucose concentration. Multiple algorithmic approaches—mean filtering, calibration mapping, and absorbance-based estimation—are included.
#Setup Steps#
1. Hardware: IR LED + IR Photodiode, LM358 amplifier, Arduino UNO.
2. Connect IR receiver output → LM358 → Arduino A0.
3. Upload code from trail_1,2,3.
4. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud to view glucose values.
Optional: Use /data/ Python scripts for plotting and analysis.

#Environment Variables#
None required. All constants (molar absorptivity, path length, thresholds) are configurable in the .ino files.
